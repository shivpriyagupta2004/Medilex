Vomiting may occur due to stomach infection, indigestion, or food poisoning. 
It is important to stay hydrated. Drink small sips of ORS (oral rehydration solution), coconut water, or clear fluids. 
Avoid oily and spicy foods until recovery. 
Children may need more fluids to prevent dehydration. 
Seek medical help if vomiting is frequent, severe, or associated with dehydration, blood, or persistent abdominal pain.
