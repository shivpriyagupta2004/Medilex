Urinary tract infection (UTI) is common in women and causes burning sensation while urinating, frequent urge to urinate, and lower abdominal pain. 
Drink plenty of water to flush out infection. 
Cranberry juice or coconut water may help. 
Avoid holding urine for long periods. 
Maintain good hygiene. 
Antibiotics are required if prescribed by a doctor. 
Seek medical care if fever, back pain, or blood in urine occurs, as this may indicate a more serious infection.
