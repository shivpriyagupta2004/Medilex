Headaches are common and may be due to stress, dehydration, lack of sleep, or viral illness. 
Drink plenty of water, rest in a quiet dark room, and avoid excessive screen time. 
Paracetamol or ibuprofen may provide relief when used correctly. 
If headaches are frequent, severe, or associated with vision problems, nausea, or weakness, consult a doctor immediately.
