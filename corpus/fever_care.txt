Fever Self-Care Guide

Fever is usually a sign that the body is fighting an infection. 
For most mild fevers, you can take care at home.

Steps:
- Drink plenty of fluids (water, soups).
- Rest as much as possible.
- Wear light clothing.
- Use a damp cloth on the forehead if uncomfortable.
- Paracetamol (acetaminophen) can be taken as advised to reduce fever.
- Avoid aspirin in children.

Red flags: 
If fever is higher than 40°C, lasts more than 3 days, or is accompanied by severe headache, chest pain, shortness of breath, or confusion — seek medical help immediately.
