Menstrual pain (period cramps) is common in women and usually occurs in the lower abdomen or back during menstruation. 
Applying a warm compress or hot water bottle can relieve cramps. 
Light exercise, gentle stretching, or yoga may also help. 
Over-the-counter medicines like ibuprofen or paracetamol can reduce pain. 
Drink warm fluids and stay hydrated. 
Seek medical advice if pain is very severe, irregular periods occur, or bleeding is unusually heavy.
