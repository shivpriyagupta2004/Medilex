Body pain is often caused by fatigue, viral infections, or overexertion. 
For mild cases, rest and hydration usually help. 
Over-the-counter medicines like paracetamol can reduce pain. 
Gentle stretching and light massage may ease discomfort. 
Seek medical advice if body pain is severe, persistent, or associated with fever, swelling, or breathing problems.
