Sore Throat Self-Care Guide

A sore throat is often caused by viral infections such as the common cold or flu. It usually improves on its own in a few days.

Steps:
- Drink warm fluids (like tea with honey, clear soups).
- Gargle with warm salt water 2â€“3 times daily.
- Use lozenges or warm drinks to soothe irritation.
- Rest your voice and avoid shouting.

Red flags:
Seek medical help if the sore throat is very severe, lasts more than 1 week, or is accompanied by high fever, difficulty breathing, or trouble swallowing.
