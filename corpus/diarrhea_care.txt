Diarrhea Self-Care Guide

Diarrhea is commonly caused by infections, food intolerance, or contaminated food/water. Most cases are mild and recover with home care.

Steps:
- Drink lots of fluids (water, rice water, clear soups).
- Use oral rehydration solution (ORS) to replace lost salts and fluids.
- Eat light, bland foods (rice, bananas, toast).
- Avoid oily, spicy, or heavy foods until recovery.

Red flags:
Seek medical help if diarrhea is bloody, very watery and frequent, lasts more than 3 days, or is accompanied by dehydration (sunken eyes, little urination, dizziness).
