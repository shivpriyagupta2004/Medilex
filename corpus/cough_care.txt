Cough Self-Care Guide

Cough is often a sign of irritation in the airways, usually from infection, allergy, or environmental causes. Many coughs improve on their own.

Steps:
- Drink warm fluids and stay hydrated.
- Use honey (if not under 1 year old).
- Rest and avoid dusty or smoky areas.
- For dry cough, soothing lozenges may help.

Red flags:
Seek medical help if cough lasts more than 3 weeks, produces blood, is accompanied by chest pain, difficulty breathing, or high fever.
